```

```
Usage: dcw [OPTIONS] SUBCOMMAND

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit

Subcommands:
  add, a                      Add named docker compose file as workspace
  rm, r                       Remove workspace
  list, l                     List registered workspaces
  up, u                       Switch to the workspace
  down, d                     Down current workspace
```

## Project file

`dcw` can use the `.dcw` project file in the source root to get information about a new project. 

Just run `dcw up` in the root of the project with the `.dcw` file and let `dcw` take care of the rest.

Sample `.dcw` project file:

```
name: myproj
composeFile: env/docker-compose.yml
```

A project file can be automatically created with the `add` command with the `-p, --create-project` flag.

## Examples

### Add workspace:

```sh
dcw add myproj /home/user/myproj/docker-compose.yml
```

### Add workspace and create dcw project file:

```sh
dcw add -p myproj docker-compose.yml
```

### List workspaces and view active:

```sh
dcw list
```

Output is:
```
ðŸŸ¢ myproj: /home/user/myproj/docker-compose.yml
âš« otherproj: /home/user/otherproj/docker-compose.yml
```

### Switch to workspace

```sh
dcw up otherproj
```

### Stop workspace and optionally purge workspace data (volumes)

```sh
dcw down -p
```
